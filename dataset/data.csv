30,2,2,Unlikely,Fear,3,6,-10,9,"Once upon a time there was a man who wanted to marry the king’s daughter, so he went to the castle.
Once he arrived, there was a gate with three guards.

He comes to the 1st guard:
“Halt, who goes there?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What brings you here?”
“I want to marry the king’s daughter.”
“OK, you may pass!”

He comes to the 2nd guard:
“Halt, who goes there?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What brings you here?”
“I want to marry the king’s daughter.”
“OK, you may pass.”

He comes to the 3rd guard:
“Halt, who goes there?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What brings you here?”
“I have come to marry the king’s daughter.”
“OK, go ahead.”

So the Red-blue knight on the white horse comes to the king:
“First of all, who are you?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What do you want here?”
“I wish to marry your daughter!”
“OK, I agree — on the condition that you first defeat the three-headed dragon. For each head there are three guards. Good luck.”

Said and done. The Red-blue knight on the white horse sets off for the dragon. Once there, he comes to the 1st guard of the 1st head:

“Halt, who goes there?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What brings you here?”
“I want to defeat the dragon!”
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

He comes to the 2nd guard of the 1st head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

He comes to the 3rd guard of the 1st head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

Chop, chop, head off.

Then he comes to the 1st guard of the 2nd head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

He comes to the 2nd guard of the 2nd head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

He comes to the 3rd guard of the 2nd head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

Chop, chop, head off — one left to go! :P

He comes to the 1st guard of the 3rd head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

He comes to the 2nd guard of the 3rd head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

He comes to the 3rd guard of the 3rd head:
(same exchange)
“Well then, I wish you the best of luck.”

Chop, chop, head off — dragon dead.

Now he has to enter the castle again through the gate with the three guards:

“Halt, who goes there?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What brings you here?”
“I want to speak to the king!”
“OK, go ahead.”

He comes to the 2nd guard:
(same exchange)
“OK, go ahead.”

He comes to the 3rd guard:
(same exchange)
“OK, go ahead.”

Then he comes to the king, who is rather forgetful:

“First of all, who were you again?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Who?”
“Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“Oooh, Red-blue knight on the white horse?”
“Yeees, Red-blue knight on the white horse!”
“What were you here for again?”
“To marry your daughter! And I have already defeated the dragon.”
“Oh. Then unfortunately I have bad news for you…”
